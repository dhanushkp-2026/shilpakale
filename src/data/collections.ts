      title: 'The Ghatika Yantra',
      introduction:
        'Before mechanical clocks, time was measured through water. The Ghatika Yantra — a water clock — dripped water at a controlled rate through a calibrated vessel. As the water level changed, marked intervals indicated elapsed time. The device was precise enough to coordinate temple rituals, astronomical observations, and daily schedules. Water became measurement.',

          content:
            'A typical Ghatika Yantra consisted of a perforated bowl placed in a larger vessel of water. The bowl slowly filled through the hole, sinking when full. The time taken to sink — precisely calibrated — measured a fixed interval called a "ghatika," approximately 24 minutes. Multiple cycles marked hours, with attendants tracking cycles to maintain accuracy. The hole size, bowl weight, and water temperature were all calibrated variables.',

          heading: 'Astronomical Calibration',
          content:
            'Water clocks were synchronized with celestial observations. The length of day and night varies seasonally, so ghatika durations were adjusted based on solar and lunar calculations. This required continuous astronomical observation and mathematical correction. Temple timekeepers maintained these calibrations, ensuring that ritual schedules aligned with cosmic cycles. The Ghatika Yantra was not just a clock — it was an instrument connecting earthly time to celestial motion.',

          content:
            'This piece preserves the logic of hydraulic timekeeping. It documents an era when time was fluid — literally — and measurement required intimate knowledge of water behavior, material properties, and astronomical mathematics. The calibration marks record the intelligence required to make time visible and reliable.',

        'Time is not self-evident. It must be constructed, measured, and maintained. This object preserves one method of that construction.',
